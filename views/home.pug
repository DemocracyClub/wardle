            | The object of the game is to guess the word. You do this by getting 
            | clues each time you guess. If you see a 
            span.letter.check-0 letter 
            | in gray, it does not appear in the solution. If you see a 
            span.letter.check-1 letter 
            | in yellow, it appears in the solution, but not where you have have 
            | guessed. And if you see a 
            span.letter.check-2 letter 
            | in green, you have that one correct!
        p 
            | Once you have all of the letters guessed, you win! You can always 
            | give up on that word and ask for a new one. And once you win, you 
            | can ask for a new word. (You will also seea link to the definition 
            | of the solved word in case you want to learn about it!)

        p 
            | You can either use the in-game virtual keyboard to type or you can 
            | use an actual keyboard. Thje in-game virtual keyboard also shows 
            | you letters you have guessed already, and their result.

        p 
            | Words come from a set of the 5000 most common English words within 
            | the given length (5 characters by default). When you guess a word, 
            | it must be in the game's dictionary! However, this dictionary includes 
            | many more words than the most common 5000.

        p 
            strong Note: 
            | Some words have more than 1 of the same letter (for example, "brood")!
            | In this case, you may get a green or yellow indicator when you use one 
            | of those letters, but there may be a duplicate! If you guess a word with 
            | two letters, you might get one green and one yellow! (A gray letter 
            em always 
            | means it does not appear at all in the solution.)

                | Why did you make this 
                a(href='https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/') Wordle 
                | clone?
        p 
            | That's a fair question. I like the game, but I didn't like only being 
            | able to play once a day, so I made this. I'm a software engineer by 
            | trade, and I like to tinker. I also can now add in options that I like!
            | Curious how this is made? You can see all of the code on 
            a(href='https://github.com/jakerella/wordle' target='_blank' title='View the Wordle Clone code on GitHub') GitHub!

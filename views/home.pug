        p 
            | The object of the game is to guess the word. You do this by getting 
            | clues each time you guess. If you see a letter in 
            span.letter.check-0 gray
            | , it does not appear in the final solution. If you see a letter in 
            span.letter.check-1 yellow
            | , it appears in the solution, but not where you have have 
            | guessed. And if you see a letter in 
            span.letter.check-2 green
            | , you have that one in the correct position!
        p 
            | Once you have all of the letters guessed, you win! You can always 
            | give up on that word and ask for a new one. And once you win, you 
            | can ask for a new word. (You will also see a link to the definition 
            | of the solved word in case you want to learn about it!)

        p 
            | You can either use the in-game virtual keyboard to type or you can 
            | use an actual keyboard. The in-game virtual keyboard also shows 
            | you letters you have guessed already, and their result.

        p 
            | Words come from the official 
            a(href='https://scrabble.merriam.com/', target='_blank') Scrabble dictionary
            | . When you guess a word, it must be in the game's dictionary! There are 
            | currently 9,330 possible 5-letter words.

        p 
            strong Note: 
            | Some words have more than 1 of the same letter (for example, "brood")! 
            | In this case, you may get a green or yellow indicator when you use one 
            | of those letters, but there may be a duplicate! If you guess a word with 
            | two letters, you might get one green and one yellow! (A gray letter 
            em always
            |  means it does not appear at all in the solution.)

        p

                | Why did you make this 
                a(href='https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/') Wordle 
                | clone?
        p 
            | That's a fair question. I like the game, but I didn't like only being 
            | able to play once a day, so I made this. I'm a software engineer by 
            | trade, and I like to tinker. I also can now add in options that I like!
            | Curious how this is made? You can see all of the code on 
            a(href='https://github.com/jakerella/wordle' target='_blank' title='View the Wordle Clone code on GitHub') GitHub!
